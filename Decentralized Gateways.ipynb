    "\n",
    "- The decentralized web is fragmented. \n",
    "- It uses different protocols i.e IPFS, Ethereum, HTTP, StorJ\n",
    "- We have to use a chrome extension like MetaMask or different browsers like Mist to access it. \n",
    "- Essentia acts as a one-stop gateway to the decentralized web that we can access in the browser\n",
    "- It gives users access to a Wallet, Storage, an Exchange, and a whole host of other decentralized applications.\n",
    "- Every Essentia user creates a unique seed which grants access to the whole Essentia framework.\n",
    "- https://medium.com/essentia_one/essentia-one-launches-11m-fund-to-foster-the-growth-of-projects-built-upon-its-protocol-c3f373fab538\n",
    "- Essentia implements the following, which we'll learn about: Cross Protocol Bridging,Blockchain seeds, Multi-Signature transfers, Encryption, and Cross Chain Atomic Swaps\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Lets see an example of how bridging 2 protocols can work https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/blob/08fb11fa896704d9e081bf64e66fac1f6d9d03dc/core/corehttp/gateway.go \n",

    "- No need to use different passwords. One Login, many dapps and apps.\n",
    "- You own your data. You can choose how much data to give away for specific use cases.\n",
    "- Multiple wallets for multiple currencies including Bitcoin, Ethereum, IOTA, and Ripple.\n",
    "- You can Store your data on decentralized storage of your choice so its encrypted and censorship-resistant.\n",
    "- Multi-chain exchange access. Because they are integrated, the app will find the best trade for you. \n",
    "- It works on any device (desktop, mobile, web, command line)\n",
    "- The storage can be used to upload your KYC informations and participate in multiples ICO with just a few clicks\n",
    "- Program scripts between all the things integrated.\n",
    "- Orchestrate operations between centralized and decentralized resources \n",

    "- This software allows the ESS-ID to destroy / restore / backup the Root-ID\n",
    "- It also allows the ESS-ID to sign / verify / encrypt / decrypt data\n",
    "- As well as allow it to generate / destroy / manage the Sub-IDs which have the same exact properties\n",
    "- multi-signature creation /management capabilities embedded.\n",
